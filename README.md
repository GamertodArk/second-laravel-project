# A basic Blog built with Laravel

This is a really basic blog built with Laravel. This is my second project using Laravel framework, I made this project to learn the basics of Laravel, I this project I learned...

- Laravel routing
- Blade Syntax
- To use some libraries of Laravel Collective
- To use artisan
- Databse migrations
- Eloquent ORM

## About the project
This is just a normal blog where the user can "send" messages to the owner. What this Blog understands by "send" is to insert the data in the databse, these messages can be seen in the Messages page. In this project I did not make any authentication system to view the messages unlike in my first project with this framework, you can visit it [here](https://github.com/GamertodArk/my-first-laravel-project 'My first Laravel Project')
